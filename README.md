\# 📉 LinkedOut: The Anti-Professional Network



> \*"I'm inventing a website for unemployed people called linkedout"\* - @ughfinewhatever (Twitter/X)



Welcome to LinkedOut. 



LinkedIn is for "humbled to announce," "strategic synergy," and 5-paragraph essays about how getting fired was a blessing. 



LinkedOut is for the rest of us. 



It is a safe space to rot in bed, admit you have no idea what you're doing, and celebrate the small Ws (like eating breakfast).



🚫 The Rules

1. No Flexing: If you talk about your "hustle", you will be banned.

2. No Jargon: The code literally blocks words like "Synergy," "ROI," "Leverage," and "Circle Back."

3. No Headshots: We don't care what you look like in a blazer.



 ✨ Features



The Buzzword Police: An automated filter that blocks toxic corporate positivity. Try to type "I am excited to optimize my workflow" and watch what happens.

The Failure Feed: A place to vent.

Hugs, Not Likes: Because "Likes" are a vanity metric. We give 🫂 Hugs here.

Honest Statuses: Set your status to "🟢 Touching Grass," "🔴 Pretending to Work," or create your own custom vibe.



🛠️ How to Run (If you must)



If you want to run this locally instead of napping:



1. Clone this repo (or don't, I'm not your boss).

2. Install the requirements:


&nbsp;  pip install streamlit



Run the app: streamlit run main.py



✨ Tech Stack



Built with Python and Streamlit.

Data is stored in SQLite (which means if you deploy this on a free tier cloud, the database wipes itself when it goes to sleep. just like my memory after 12 PM)
